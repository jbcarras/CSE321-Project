**Automatic Cat Door**

Set up:
To set up, you must plug in the infrared sensors and the seven segment display.

  Inside sensor: Plug the inside sensor into pin 9, power, and ground.
  Outside sensor: Plug the outdoor sensor into pin 2, power, and ground.
  Seven segment display: Plug the seven segment display into pins 4-7 and 11-13, power, and ground. Look to the documentation for the exact pins to connect.

When it is set up and the code is uploaded to the Arduino Uno, the device will run without further human intervention. It will use an infrared sensor to detect when a cat goes outside, which will increment the count.

That's it!
